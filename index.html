<h2 id="financial-forecasting-and-backtesting-with-machine-learning-capstone-project"><a name="proj1"></a>Financial Forecasting and Backtesting with Machine Learning (Capstone Project)</h2>
<p>This project aims to perform a survey of financial forecasting techniques with machine learning for use in stock price prediction. To reduce noise in the predictions, we decided to predict the following day’s high price from the current day’s closing price. Additionally, this also allows for ability to potentially generate alpha in actual application, despite a potential negative return day-over-day. The predictions are then run through a strategy back tester as a form of cross-validation and efficacy testing. Interestingly, success in prediction does not always correlate to success in practical trading.</p>

<p>Personal contributions to this project include data acquisition, feature engineering, data preprocessing, linear/univariate and Random Forest model creation, final reporting, and approach consulting as the industry veteran of the team.</p>

<h2 id="value-stock-screener-milestone-i-project"><a name="proj2"></a>Value Stock Screener (Milestone I Project)</h2>
<p>This was an early project in the program, designed to create a data pipeline that scraped for the current S&amp;P 500 ticker list, pulled data from Quandl (now Nasdaq) and Yahoo! Finance, and then through modular code filters for value stocks and returns a dataframe report of possible options and corresponding investing metrics.</p>

<p>1-Year returns from the stocks listed in the report were as follows (adj. prices as of 12/2021):</p>

<table>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Given the success of the returns, I am in the process of refactoring the Jupyter Notebook scripts into OOP-based code instead of functions, and the selected securities (both these and subsequent iterations of the script outputs) are in paper trading for long-term efficacy in changing markets. Exit strategies are being researched in a back testing framework. Next steps include integration into bots for trading signals, or, regulations permitting, active trading bots.</p>

<p>Personal contributions to this project include data acquisition, data preprocessing, the final write-up, and the bulk of code development given my experience in finance.</p>
