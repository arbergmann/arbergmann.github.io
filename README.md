<i>February 2020 - Present</i><br/>
Saint Louis, MO <br/>
<b>Data Analyst</b>
- Led annual pricing review initiatives to benchmark company pricing policies and generated scenario analyses for future pricing changes. This effort led to a nearly year-long evaluation of present and future/long-term pricing strategies.
- Conducted pain point research analysis for future business strategy consideration. 
- Created a dynamic practice impact calculator to determine changing industry effects on branches for varying business strategies. The calculator was leveraged for the production of a branch-facing tool to provide significant value to the field. This project utilized analytical acumen as it pertains to database capacity, best practices for calculation logics, and branch practice business acumen.
- Worked with business owners and project leaders to develop KPIs, and leverage economic models in efforts to research new business strategy proposals.
- Consulted on a DEI initiative design and analysis for financial advisor groups. This included conducting propensity scoring, control group design, A/B testing, and subsequent initiative efficacy analysis in Python.
- Assisted in the review of a previous focus client measure and supervised learning model to ensure continued feature relevance and potential use cases in other future business developments. This review also included the exploration of gaps and opportunities for the model going forward, and any potential road blocks in potential analyses. This project required significant ETL capabilities and data source acumen.
- Peer reviewed an LOA / Money Laundering detection initiative that ultimately impacts and strives to protect over $12 million in potentially affected client funds.
- Assisted with development, scenario modeling, and peer review of a program migration model for potential future business segments, where over $1T of client funds and approximately 19,000 advisors would be affected by program parameters.
- Facilitated supporting redundancies in Python for a supervised and unsupervised learning client lifetime value project generated in R, for future business purposes.
- Developed a workbook library for basic Python training, as well as collaborated on repositories containing code snippets and parameters for best practices.

## <a name="proj1"></a>Financial Forecasting and Backtesting with Machine Learning (Capstone Project)
This project aims to perform a survey of financial forecasting techniques with machine learning for use in stock price prediction. To reduce noise in the predictions, we decided to predict the following day's high price from the current day's closing price. Additionally, this also allows for ability to potentially generate alpha in actual application, despite a potential negative return day-over-day. The predictions are then run through a strategy back tester as a form of cross-validation and efficacy testing. Interestingly, success in prediction does not always correlate to success in practical trading.
   
Personal contributions to this project include data acquisition, feature engineering, data preprocessing, linear/univariate and Random Forest model creation, final reporting, and approach consulting as the industry veteran of the team.

## <a name="proj2"></a>Value Stock Screener (Milestone I Project)
This was an early project in the program, designed to create a data pipeline that scraped for the current S&P 500 ticker list, pulled data from Quandl (now Nasdaq) and Yahoo! Finance, and then through modular code filters for value stocks and returns a dataframe report of possible options and corresponding investing metrics. 
   
1-Year returns from the stocks listed in the report were as follows (adj. prices as of 12/2021):

|Symbol| Price 09-25-2020 | Price 09-24-2021 | Return (Adj.) |
| ---- |:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| MET  |$36.26 ($34.69 adj)  |$61.36 ($60.90 adj)  | 75.6%           |
| XRX  |$17.98 ($16.98 adj)  |$20.77 ($20.52 adj)  | 20.8%           |
| HIG  |$35.80 ($34.36 adj)  |$69.40 ($69.01 adj)  | 100.8%          |
| MS   |$47.04 ($45.61 adj)  |$102.91 ($102.20 adj)| 124.1%          |
| PNC  |$104.90 ($101.09 adj)|$194.50 ($193.29 adj)| 91.2%           |
| KIM  |$11.22 ($10.76 adj)  |$21.60 ($21.44 adj)  | 99.3%           |

Given the success of the returns, I am in the process developing the Jupyter Notebook scripts into more OOP code, and the script is in paper trading for long-term efficacy in changing markets. Exit strategies are being researched in a back testing framework. Next steps include integration into bots for trading signals, or, regulations permitting, active trading bots.
   
Personal contributions to this project include data acquisition, data preprocessing, the final write-up, and the bulk of code development given my experience in finance.
